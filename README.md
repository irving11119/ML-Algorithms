# ML-Algorithms

## Summary

This repository contains a collection of machine learning models learnt through my time as an NUS student as well as what I have picked up on my own through my own self-learning.

## Description

The source code in this repository is meant to provide a high-level demonstration of the implementation of the ML models I have learnt and understood. They do not contain the mathematical proofs behind this models.

The models are implemented using scikit-learn, a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support-vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.

The datasets used for the demonstration of these models are from the toy datasets provided in the scikit-learn library.
